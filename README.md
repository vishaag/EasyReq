## SECTION 2 : EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
With many students and working employees coming in to Singapore, either for studies or work related environments, housing has become the first priority for all of them. While either moving in to a house for the first time, or moving houses after a period of time, there exists a lot of forms that need to be manually filled which may become exhausting for the customer.

Based on robotic process and intelligent process automation concepts, our group of four members, brainstormed and decided to build a system that can easily automate this process of form filling when searching/relocation of houses, based on the customer details. The entire system would be a chatbot based system where a customer can interact with an intelligent chatbot, which would assist him/her to fill up various forms that are required, and moreover, organize key appointments that maybe required in certain cases.

We began by getting a good understanding of the overall key processes of the proposed solution. Next, we determined the areas which needed targeting that we agreed should be implemented into business processes. We also made sure we analysed the processes with our improvements and see how these improvements were handled with test cases to validate our assumptions. 

The outcome of the system, is that the system would share screenshots of the filled forms to the user for his consent, post which, based on the approval the respective forms can be ‘submitted’.
